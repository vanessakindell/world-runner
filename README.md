# world-runner
A simple fan tribute endless-runner of the first level from The 3D Battles of World Runner for NES

Built using Blitz3D v1.94. Compatibility with other versions is untested and not supported. It will not work with BlitzBasic, BlitzPlus, BlitzMax, or Max3D.

There's almost certainly there's old high school jokes, memes, nonsense, and warnings about external release in the code. I have not bothered to go back and fix any of it as I have better things to do with my time. They can be safely ignored or if someone cares enough to go through and remove then by all means knock yourself out.
